                <p>BiQ App Framework was created to provide the ability to quickly build very tailored apps using the Analytics API.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full control over the look and feel with pure html and javascript.</li>
                    <li>Control over queries and updating the data on the fly.</li>
                    <li>Control over how to visualize the data and being able to interact with the visualizations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Built on open source libraries. This allows you to easily integrate any libraries that you would like to use.
                    We also wrap these libraries by using Chart and Component objects, which allows you to swap libraries if you like.
                    Most Libraries have their Pros and Cons and we have chosen to pick a few libraries and mix and match based on the use case.
